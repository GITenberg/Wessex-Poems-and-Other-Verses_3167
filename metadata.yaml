description: Hardy's verse is spare, unadorned, and unromatic, and its pervasive theme
  is man's futile struggle against cosmic forces. Like many of his novels, these 51
  poems are set against the bleak and forbidding Dorset landscape, whose physical
  harshness echoes that of an indifferent, if not malevolent, universe.
