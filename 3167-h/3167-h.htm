<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>PREFACE
TO WESSEX POEMS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the miscellaneous collection of
verse that follows, only four pieces have been published, though
many were written long ago, and other partly written.&nbsp; In
some few cases the verses were turned into prose and printed as
such, it having been unanticipated at that time that they might
see the light.</p>
<p>Whenever an ancient and legitimate word of the district, for
which there was no equivalent in received English, suggested
itself as the most natural, nearest, and often only expression of
a thought, it has been made use of, on what seemed good
grounds.</p>
<p><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>The
pieces are in a large degree dramatic or personative in
conception; and this even where they are not obviously so.</p>
<p>The dates attached to some of the poems do not apply to the
rough sketches given in illustration, which have been recently
made, and, as may be surmised, are inserted for personal and
local reasons rather than for their intrinsic qualities.</p>

<h2>THE TEMPORARY THE ALL</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Change</span> and
chancefulness in my flowering youthtime,<br />
Set me sun by sun near to one unchosen;<br />
Wrought us fellow-like, and despite divergence,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Friends interlinked us.</p>

forthcome&mdash;<br />
Come the rich fulfiller of my prevision;<br />
Life is roomy yet, and the odds unbounded.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So self-communed I.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thwart my wistful way did a damsel saunter,<br
/>
Fair, the while unformed to be all-eclipsing;<br />
&ldquo;Maiden meet,&rdquo; held I, &ldquo;till arise my
forefelt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wonder of women.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Long a visioned hermitage deep desiring,<br />
Tenements uncouth I was fain to house in;<br />
&ldquo;Let such lodging be for a breath-while,&rdquo; thought
I,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Soon a more seemly.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Then, high handiwork will I make my
life-deed,<br />
Truth and Light outshow; but the ripe time pending,<br />
Intermissive aim at the thing sufficeth.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus I . . . But lo, me!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Bettered not has Fate or my hand&rsquo;s achieving;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Never transcended!</p>

4</span>AMABEL</h2>
<p class="poetry">I <span class="smcap">marked</span> her ruined
hues,<br />
Her custom-straitened views,<br />
And asked, &ldquo;Can there indwell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Amabel?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">I looked upon her gown,<br />
Once rose, now earthen brown;<br />
The change was like the knell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Amabel.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>Her step&rsquo;s mechanic ways<br />
Had lost the life of May&rsquo;s;<br />
Her laugh, once sweet in swell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spoilt Amabel.</p>
<p class="poetry">I mused: &ldquo;Who sings the strain<br />
I sang ere warmth did wane?<br />
Who thinks its numbers spell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His Amabel?&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Knowing that, though Love cease,<br />
Love&rsquo;s race shows undecrease;<br />
All find in dorp or dell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An Amabel.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;I felt that I could creep<br />
To some housetop, and weep,<br />
That Time the tyrant fell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ruled Amabel!</p>
<p class="poetry">I said (the while I sighed<br />
That love like ours had died),<br />
&ldquo;Fond things I&rsquo;ll no more tell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Amabel,</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

And fling across the gate,<br />
&lsquo;Till the Last Trump, farewell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O Amabel!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>HAP</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">If</span> but some vengeful
god would call to me <br />
From up the sky, and laugh: &ldquo;Thou suffering thing,<br />
Know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy,<br />
That thy love&rsquo;s loss is my hate&rsquo;s
profiting!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then would I bear, and clench myself, and
die,<br />
Steeled by the sense of ire unmerited;<br />
Half-eased in that a Powerfuller than I<br />
Had willed and meted me the tears I shed.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>But not so.&nbsp; How arrives it joy lies slain,<br />
And why unblooms the best hope ever sown?<br />
&mdash;Crass Casualty obstructs the sun and rain,<br />
And dicing Time for gladness casts a moan . . .<br />
These purblind Doomsters had as readily strown<br />
Blisses about my pilgrimage as pain.</p>

9</span>&ldquo;IN VISION I ROAMED&rdquo;<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TO &mdash;</span></h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">In</span> vision I roamed
the flashing Firmament,<br />
So fierce in blazon that the Night waxed wan,<br />
As though with an awed sense of such ostent;<br />
And as I thought my spirit ranged on and on</p>
<p class="poetry">In footless traverse through ghast heights of
sky,<br />
To the last chambers of the monstrous Dome,<br />
Where stars the brightest here to darkness die:<br />
Then, any spot on our own Earth seemed Home!</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>And the sick grief that you were far away<br />
Grew pleasant thankfulness that you were near?<br />
Who might have been, set on some outstep sphere,<br />
Less than a Want to me, as day by day<br />
I lived unware, uncaring all that lay<br />

We rolled rich puncheons of Spanish grape,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; A woman, a sylph, or sprite.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Afeard she fled, and with heated head<br

I pursued to the chamber she called her own;<br />

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;She raised her beseeching eyes to me,<br

And I heard the words of prayer she sent<br />
In her own soft language . . . Seemingly<br />
I copied those eyes for my punishment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In begetting the girl you see!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;So, to-day I stand with a God-set

<span class="GutSmall">(17&ndash;)</span></h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> sun had wheeled
from Grey&rsquo;s to Dammer&rsquo;s Crest,<br />
And still I mused on that Thing imminent:<br />
At length I sought the High-street to the West.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>The level flare raked pane and pediment<br />
And my wrecked face, and shaped my nearing friend<br />
Like one of those the Furnace held unshent.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve news concerning her,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Attend.<br />
They fly to-night at the late moon&rsquo;s first gleam:<br />
Watch with thy steel: two righteous thrusts will end</p>
<p class="poetry">Her shameless visions and his passioned
dream.<br />
I&rsquo;ll watch with thee, to testify thy wrong&mdash;<br />
To aid, maybe.&mdash;Law consecrates the scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">I started, and we paced the flags along<br />
Till I replied: &ldquo;Since it has come to this<br />
I&rsquo;ll do it!&nbsp; But alone.&nbsp; I can be
strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Three hours past Curfew, when the Froom&rsquo;s
mild hiss<br />
Reigned sole, undulled by whirr of merchandize,<br />
From Pummery-Tout to where the Gibbet is,</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>I crossed my pleasaunce hard by Glyd&rsquo;path Rise,<br

And stood beneath the wall.&nbsp; Eleven strokes went,<br />
And to the door they came, contrariwise,</p>
<p class="poetry">And met in clasp so close I had but bent<br />
My lifted blade upon them to have let<br />
Their two souls loose upon the firmament.</p>
<p class="poetry">But something held my arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
moment yet<br />
As pray-time ere you wantons die!&rdquo; I said;<br />
And then they saw me.&nbsp; Swift her gaze was set</p>
<p class="poetry">With eye and cry of love illimited<br />
Upon her Heart-king.&nbsp; Never upon me<br />
Had she thrown look of love so thorough-sped! . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">At once she flung her faint form shieldingly<br
/>
On his, against the vengeance of my vows;<br />
The which o&rsquo;erruling, her shape shielded he.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>Blanked by such love, I stood as in a drowse,<br />
And the slow moon edged from the upland nigh,<br />
My sad thoughts moving thuswise: &ldquo;I may house</p>
<p class="poetry">And I may husband her, yet what am I<br />
But licensed tyrant to this bonded pair?<br />
Says Charity, Do as ye would be done by.&rdquo; . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">Hurling my iron to the bushes there,<br />
I bade them stay.&nbsp; And, as if brain and breast<br />
Were passive, they walked with me to the stair.</p>
<p class="poetry">Inside the house none watched; and on we
prest<br />
Before a mirror, in whose gleam I read<br />
Her beauty, his,&mdash;and mine own mien unblest;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>Till at her room I turned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; I
said,<br />
&ldquo;Have you the wherewithal for this?&nbsp; Pray speak.<br />
Love fills no cupboard.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll need daily
bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve nothing, sire,&rdquo; said
she; &ldquo;and nothing seek.<br />
&rsquo;Twere base in me to rob my lord unware;<br />
Our hands will earn a pittance week by week.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And next I saw she&rsquo;d piled her raiment
rare<br />
Within the garde-robes, and her household purse,<br />
Her jewels, and least lace of personal wear;</p>
<p class="poetry">And stood in homespun.&nbsp; Now grown wholly
hers,<br />
I handed her the gold, her jewels all,<br />
And him the choicest of her robes diverse.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you to the doorway in the
wall,<br />
And then adieu,&rdquo; I to them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Friends,
withdraw.&rdquo;<br />
They did so; and she went&mdash;beyond recall.</p>
<p class="poetry">And as I paused beneath the arch I saw<br />
Their moonlit figures&mdash;slow, as in surprise&mdash;<br />
Descend the slope, and vanish on the haw.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Fool,&rsquo; some will
say,&rdquo; I thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;But who is wise,<br />
Save God alone, to weigh my reasons why?&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;&ldquo;Hast thou struck home?&rdquo; came with the
boughs&rsquo; night-sighs.</p>
<p class="poetry">It was my friend.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have struck
well.&nbsp; They fly,<br />
But carry wounds that none can cicatrize.&rdquo;<br />
&mdash;&ldquo;Not mortal?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lingering&mdash;worse,&rdquo; said I.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Would trouble us again.</p>

When, reassured at length, we went to rest&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My children, wife, and I.</p>
<p class="poetry">But what was this that broke our humble
ease?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What noise, above the rain,<br />
Above the dripping of the poplar trees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That smote along the pane?</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;A call of mastery, bidding me arise,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Splashed&mdash;sweating from every pore.</p>
<p class="poetry">Had I seen Grouchy?&nbsp; Yes?&nbsp; Which
track took he?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could I lead thither on?&mdash;<br />
Fulfilment would ensure gold pieces three,<br />

82</span>&ldquo;I bear the Emperor&rsquo;s mandate,&rdquo; then

sought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To estimate his say.<br />
Grouchy had made for Wavre; and yet, on thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not lead that way.</p>
<p class="poetry">I mused: &ldquo;If Grouchy thus instructed
be,<br />

<p class="poetry">Near Ottignies we passed, across the Dyle<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Lim&rsquo;lette left far aside),<br />
And thence direct toward Pervez and Noville<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Through green grain, till he cried:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I doubt thy conduct, man! no track is
here&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I doubt thy gag&egrave;d word!&rdquo;<br />
Thereat he scowled on me, and pranced me near,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pricked me with his sword.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>&ldquo;Nay, Captain, hold!&nbsp; We skirt, not trace the
course<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Grouchy,&rdquo; said I then:<br />
&ldquo;As we go, yonder went he, with his force<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thirty thousand men.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;At length noon nighed; when west, from
Saint-John&rsquo;s-Mound,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A hoarse artillery boomed,<br />
And from Saint-Lambert&rsquo;s upland, chapel-crowned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Prussian squadrons loomed.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then to the wayless wet gray ground he
leapt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;My mission fails!&rdquo; he cried;<br />
&ldquo;Too late for Grouchy now to intercept,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For, peasant, you have lied!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">He turned to pistol me.&nbsp; I sprang, and
drew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sabre from his flank,<br />
And &rsquo;twixt his nape and shoulder, ere he knew,<br />

Beside her spouse; till springtide blood<br />
Seemed scouring through her like a flood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That whisked the years away.</p>
<p class="poetry">She rose, and rayed, and decked her head<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the bleached hairs ran thin;<br />
Upon her cap two bows of red<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She fixed with hasty pin;<br />
Unheard descending to the street,<br />
She trod the flags with tune-led feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And stood before the Inn.</p>
<p class="poetry">Save for the dancers&rsquo;, not a sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Disturbed the icy air;<br />
No watchman on his midnight round<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Checked by a sergeant tall:<br />
&ldquo;Gay Granny, whence come you?&rdquo; he cried;<br />

&mdash;&ldquo;No one has more right here than me!<br />
Ere you were born, man,&rdquo; answered she,<br />

They seized and whirled her &rsquo;mid the maze,<br />
And Jenny felt as in the days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of her immodesty.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hour chased each hour, and night advanced;<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; She sped as shod with wings;<br />
Each time and every time she danced&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reels, jigs, poussettes, and flings:<br />
<a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>They

<p class="poetry">The &ldquo;Fall of Paris&rdquo; clanged its
close,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Peter&rsquo;s chime told four,<br />

They tiptoed in escorting her,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; No life stirred, near or far.</p>
<p class="poetry">Though inner mischief worked amain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She reached her husband&rsquo;s side;<br />

She felt she could have given her life<br />
To be the single-hearted wife<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That she had been erstwhile.</p>
<p class="poetry">Time wore to six.&nbsp; Her husband rose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And struck the steel and stone;<br />
He glanced at Jenny, whose repose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seemed deeper than his own.<br />
With dumb dismay, on closer sight,<br />
He gathered sense that in the night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or morn, her soul had flown.</p>
<p class="poetry">When told that some too mighty strain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For one so many-yeared<br />
Had burst her bosom&rsquo;s master-vein,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His doubts remained unstirred.<br />
His Jenny had not left his side<br />
Betwixt the eve and morning-tide:<br />

And when they went from Casterbridge<br />
And vanished over Mellstock Ridge,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas saddest morn to see.</p>

That she gazed and gazed; and then could trace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The truth there; and she believed.</p>
<p class="poetry">She laid a hand on the dresser-ledge,<br />

And stood; and you heard the wind-swept sedge<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rippling Froom; till she cried:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;O my chamber&rsquo;s untidied, unmade my
bed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the day has begun to wear!<br />
&lsquo;What a slovenly hussif!&rsquo; it will be said,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Depressed by his neighbour&rsquo;s doom,<br />
And amazed that a wife struck to widowhood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thought first of her unkempt room.</p>
<p class="poetry">But a fortnight thence she could take no
food,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she pined in a slow decay;<br />
While Kit soon lost his mournful mood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And laughed in his ancient way.</p>

With one who kindled gaily<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Love&rsquo;s fitful ecstasies!<br />
But despite the term as teacher,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I remain what I was then<br />
In each essential feature<br />

FIRE AT TRANTER SWEATLEY&rsquo;S</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">They</span> had long met
o&rsquo; Zundays&mdash;her true love and she&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And at junketings, maypoles, and flings;<br />
But she bode wi&rsquo; a thirtover uncle, and he<br />
Swore by noon and by night that her goodman should be<br />
Naibour Sweatley&mdash;a gaffer oft weak at the knee<br />
From taking o&rsquo; sommat more cheerful than tea&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who tranted, and moved people&rsquo;s things.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

would he hear;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then with wild rainy eyes she obeyed.<br />
She chid when her Love was for clinking off wi&rsquo; her.<br />
The pa&rsquo;son was told, as the season drew near<br />
To throw over pu&rsquo;pit the names of the pe&auml;ir<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As fitting one flesh to be made.</p>
<p class="poetry">The wedding-day dawned and the morning drew
on;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The couple stood bridegroom and bride;<br />
The evening was passed, and when midnight had gone<br />
The folks horned out, &ldquo;God save the King,&rdquo; and
anon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The two home-along gloomily hied.</p>
<p class="poetry">The lover Tim Tankens mourned heart-sick and
drear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To be thus of his darling deprived:<br />
He roamed in the dark ath&rsquo;art field, mound, and mere,<br />
<a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>And,
a&rsquo;most without knowing it, found himself near<br />
The house of the tranter, and now of his Dear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the lantern-light showed &rsquo;em
arrived.</p>
<p class="poetry">The bride sought her cham&rsquo;er so calm and
so pale<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That a Northern had thought her resigned;<br />
But to eyes that had seen her in tide-times of weal,<br />
Like the white cloud o&rsquo; smoke, the red battle-field&rsquo;s
vail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That look spak&rsquo; of havoc behind.</p>
<p class="poetry">The bridegroom yet laitered a beaker to
drain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then reeled to the linhay for more,<br />
When the candle-snoff kindled some chaff from his grain&mdash;<br
/>
Flames spread, and red vlankers, wi&rsquo; might and wi&rsquo;
main,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And round beams, thatch, and chimley-tun roar.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Through brimble and underwood tears,<br />
Till he comes to the orchet, when crooping thereright<br />
In the lewth of a codlin-tree, bivering wi&rsquo; fright,<br />
Wi&rsquo; on&rsquo;y her night-rail to screen her from sight,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; His lonesome young Barbree appears.</p>
<p class="poetry">Her cwold little figure half-naked he views<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Played about by the frolicsome breeze,<br />
Her light-tripping totties, her ten little tooes,<br />
All bare and besprinkled wi&rsquo; Fall&rsquo;s chilly dews,<br
/>
While her great gallied eyes, through her hair hanging loose,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheened as stars through a tardle o&rsquo;
trees.</p>
<p class="poetry">She eyed en; and, as when a weir-hatch is
drawn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tears, penned by terror afore,<br />
<a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>With a

<p class="poetry">&ldquo;O Tim, my <i>own</i> Tim I must call
&rsquo;ee&mdash;I will!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All the world ha&rsquo; turned round on me so!<br />
Can you help her who loved &rsquo;ee, though acting so ill?<br />
Can you pity her misery&mdash;feel for her still?<br />
When worse than her body so quivering and chill<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is her heart in its winter o&rsquo; woe!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I think I mid almost ha&rsquo; borne
it,&rdquo; she said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Had my griefs one by one come to hand;<br />
But O, to be slave to thik husbird for bread,<br />
And then, upon top o&rsquo; that, driven to wed,<br />
And then, upon top o&rsquo; that, burnt out o&rsquo; bed,<br />

outsprung&mdash;<br />
(Tim had a great soul when his feelings were wrung)&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Feel for &rsquo;ee, dear Barbree?&rdquo; he
cried;<br />
And his warm working-jacket about her he flung,<br />
Made a back, horsed her up, till behind him she clung<br />
Like a chiel on a gipsy, her figure uphung<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By the sleeves that around her he tied.</p>
<p class="poetry">Over piggeries, and mixens, and apples, and
hay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They lumpered straight into the night;<br />
And finding bylong where a halter-path lay,<br />
At dawn reached Tim&rsquo;s house, on&rsquo;y seen on their
way<br />
By a naibour or two who were up wi&rsquo; the day;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But they gathered no clue to the sight.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then tender Tim Tankens he searched here and
there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For some garment to clothe her fair skin;<br />
<a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>But
though he had breeches and waistcoats to spare,<br />
He had nothing quite seemly for Barbree to wear,<br />
Who, half shrammed to death, stood and cried on a chair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At the caddle she found herself in.</p>
<p class="poetry">There was one thing to do, and that one thing
he did,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He lent her some clouts of his own,<br />
And she took &rsquo;em perforce; and while in &rsquo;em she
slid,<br />
Tim turned to the winder, as modesty bid,<br />
Thinking, &ldquo;O that the picter my duty keeps hid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To the sight o&rsquo; my eyes mid be
shown!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">In the tallet he stowed her; there huddied she
lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortening sleeves, legs, and tails to her limbs;<br

But most o&rsquo; the time in a mortal bad way,<br />
<a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>Well
knowing that there&rsquo;d be the divel to pay<br />
If &rsquo;twere found that, instead o&rsquo; the elements&rsquo;

&nbsp;&nbsp; She was living in lodgings at Tim&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the tranter?&rdquo; said
men and boys; &ldquo;where can er be?&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the tranter?&rdquo; said
Barbree alone.<br />
&ldquo;Where on e&rsquo;th is the tranter?&rdquo; said
everybod-y:<br />
They sifted the dust of his perished roof-tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And all they could find was a bone.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>Then the uncle cried, &ldquo;Lord, pray have mercy on
me!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And in terror began to repent.<br />
But before &rsquo;twas complete, and till sure she was free,<br
/>
Barbree drew up her loft-ladder, tight turned her key&mdash;<br
/>
Tim bringing up breakfast and dinner and tea&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the news of her hiding got vent.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then followed the custom-kept rout, shout, and
flare<br />
Of a skimmington-ride through the naibourhood, ere<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Folk had proof o&rsquo; wold Sweatley&rsquo;s
decay.<br />
Whereupon decent people all stood in a stare,<br />
Saying Tim and his lodger should risk it, and pair:<br />
So he took her to church.&nbsp; An&rsquo; some laughing lads
there<br />
Cried to Tim, &ldquo;After Sweatley!&rdquo;&nbsp; She said,
&ldquo;I declare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I stand as a maiden to-day!&rdquo;</p>

An arch-designer, for she planned to build.<br />

In every intervolve of high and wide&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Well fit to be her guide.</p>
<p

&ldquo;An hour will come when sight of such sweet nook<br />
Would bring a bitterness too sharp to brook,<br />
When brighter eyes have won away his look;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For you will fade.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Then said she faintly: &ldquo;O, contrive some
way&mdash;<br />
Some narrow winding turret, quite mine own,<br />
To reach a loft where I may grieve alone!<br />
It is a slight thing; hence do not, I pray,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This last dear fancy slay!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Such winding ways<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Fit not your days,&rdquo;<br />

TWO MEN</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> were two
youths of equal age,<br />
Wit, station, strength, and parentage;<br />
They studied at the selfsame schools,<br />
And shaped their thoughts by common rules.</p>
<p class="poetry">One pondered on the life of man,<br />
His hopes, his ending, and began<br />
To rate the Market&rsquo;s sordid war<br />
As something scarce worth living for.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll brace to higher aims,&rdquo; said
he,<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll further Truth and Purity;<br />
Thereby to mend the mortal lot<br />
And sweeten sorrow.&nbsp; Thrive I not,</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Winning their hearts, my kind will
give<br />
Enough that I may lowly live,<br />
And house my Love in some dim dell,<br />
For pleasing them and theirs so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Idly attired, with features wan,<br />
In secret swift he laboured on:<br />
Such press of power had brought much gold<br />
Applied to things of meaner mould.</p>
<p class="poetry">Sometimes he wished his aims had been<br />
To gather gains like other men;<br />
Then thanked his God he&rsquo;d traced his track<br />
Too far for wish to drag him back.</p>
<p class="poetry">He look&egrave;d from his loft one day<br />
To where his slighted garden lay;<br />
Nettles and hemlock hid each lawn,<br />
And every flower was starved and gone.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>He fainted in his heart, whereon<br />
He rose, and sought his plighted one,<br />
Resolved to loose her bond withal,<br />
Lest she should perish in his fall.</p>
<p class="poetry">He met her with a careless air,<br />
As though he&rsquo;d ceased to find her fair,<br />
And said: &ldquo;True love is dust to me;<br />
I cannot kiss: I tire of thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">(That she might scorn him was he fain,<br />
To put her sooner out of pain;<br />
For incensed love breathes quick and dies,<br />
When famished love a-lingering lies.)</p>
<p class="poetry">Once done, his soul was so betossed,<br />
It found no more the force it lost:<br />
Hope was his only drink and food,<br />
And hope extinct, decay ensued.</p>
<p class="poetry">And, living long so closely penned,<br />
He had not kept a single friend;<br />
He dwindled thin as phantoms be,<br />
And drooped to death in poverty . . .</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>Meantime his schoolmate had gone out<br />
To join the fortune-finding rout;<br />
He liked the winnings of the mart,<br />
But wearied of the working part.</p>
<p class="poetry">He turned to seek a privy lair,<br />
Neglecting note of garb and hair,<br />
And day by day reclined and thought<br />
How he might live by doing nought.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I plan a valued scheme,&rdquo; he
said<br />
To some.&nbsp; &ldquo;But lend me of your bread,<br />
And when the vast result looms nigh,<br />
In profit you shall stand as I.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet they took counsel to restrain<br />
Their kindness till they saw the gain;<br />
And, since his substance now had run,<br />
He rose to do what might be done.</p>
<p class="poetry">He went unto his Love by night,<br />
And said: &ldquo;My Love, I faint in fight:<br />
Deserving as thou dost a crown,<br />
My cares shall never drag thee down.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>(He had descried a maid whose line<br />
Would hand her on much corn and wine,<br />
And held her far in worth above<br />
One who could only pray and love.)</p>
<p class="poetry">But this Fair read him; whence he failed<br />
To do the deed so blithely hailed;<br />
He saw his projects wholly marred,<br />
And gloom and want oppressed him hard;</p>
<p class="poetry">Till, living to so mean an end,<br />
Whereby he&rsquo;d lost his every friend,<br />
He perished in a pauper sty,<br />
His mate the dying pauper nigh.</p>
<p class="poetry">And moralists, reflecting, said,<br />
As &ldquo;dust to dust&rdquo; in burial read<br />
Was echoed from each coffin-lid,<br />
&ldquo;These men were like in all they did.&rdquo;</p>

&mdash;When mumming and grave projects are allied,<br />
Perhaps an Epilogue is justified.</p>

Commanded most our musings; least the play:<br />
A purpose futile but for your good-will<br />
Swiftly responsive to the cry of ill:<br />

Frail human flowerets, sicklied by the shade,<br />

<p class="poetry">Who has not marked, where the full cheek should
be,<br />
Incipient lines of lank flaccidity,<br />
Lymphatic pallor where the pink should glow,<br />
And where the throb of transport, pulses low?&mdash;<br />
Most tragical of shapes from Pole to Line,<br />
O wondering child, unwitting Time&rsquo;s design,<br />
Why should Art add to Nature&rsquo;s quandary,<br />
And worsen ill by thus immuring thee?<br />
&mdash;That races do despite unto their own,<br />
That Might supernal do indeed condone<br />
Wrongs individual for the general ease,<br />

Mothered by those whose protest is &ldquo;No more!&rdquo;<br />
Vitalized without option: who shall say<br />
That did Life hang on choosing&mdash;Yea or Nay&mdash;<br />
They had not scorned it with such penalty,<br />
And nothingness implored of Destiny?</p>
<p class="poetry">And yet behind the horizon smile serene<br />
The down, the cornland, and the stretching green&mdash;<br />
Space&mdash;the child&rsquo;s heaven: scenes which at least
ensure<br />
Some palliative for ill they cannot cure.</p>
<p class="poetry">Dear friends&mdash;now moved by this poor show
of ours<br />
To make your own long joy in buds and bowers<br />

brief while the joy of infant eyes,<br />

And say, &ldquo;Would God it came to pass<br />
My heart had shrunk as thin!&rdquo;</p>

By hearts grown cold to me,<br />
Could lonely wait my endless rest<br />
With equanimity.</p>

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
